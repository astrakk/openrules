# OpenRules

## What is this?
OpenRules is a unified ruleset for use in Australian TF2 Jailbreak servers. The aim of this project is to reduce the amount of confusion when switching between server communities by having a common base set of rules.

## What if the community doesn't agree with these rules?
No problem! The best part about operating out of a public git repo is that anyone can submit a pull request to suggest some changes. Whether you're a server owner or a player, everyone has a say.
